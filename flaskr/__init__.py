def create_app(test_config=None):
    #creating and configuring the app flask instance

    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)
    #__name__ is the name of the current Python module. The app needs to know where it’s located to set up some paths, and __name__ is a convenient way to tell it that.

    #instance_relative_config=True tells the app that configuration files are relative to the instance folder. The instance folder is located outside the flaskr package and can hold local data that shouldn’t be committed to version control, such as configuration secrets and the database file.

    app.config.from_mapping(
        SECRET_KEY='dev',
        DATABASE=os.path.join(app.instance_path, 'flaskr.sqlite')
    )

    #SECRET_KEY is used by Flask and extensions to keep data safe. It’s set to 'dev' to provide a convenient value during development, but it should be overridden with a random value when deploying.

    #DATABASE is the path where the SQLite database file will be saved. It’s under app.instance_path, which is the path that Flask has chosen for the instance folder.

    if test_config is None:
        # load the instance config, if it exists, when not testing
        app.config.from_pyfile('config.py', silent=True)
    else:
        #load test config if passed in
        app.config.from_mapping(test_config)
        #overrides the default configuration with values taken from the config.py file in the instance folder if it exists. For example, when deploying, this can be used to set a real SECRET_KEY.

        #test_config can also be passed to the factory, and will be used instead of the instance configuration. This is so the tests you’ll write later in the tutorial can be configured independently of any development values you have configured.

    #ensure the instance folder exists
    try:
        os.makedirs(app.instance_path)
    except OSError:
        pass
        #ensures that app.instance_path exists. Flask doesn’t create the instance folder automatically, but it needs to be created because your project will create the SQLite database file there.

    # a simple page that says hello

    @app.route('/hello')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello, World!'

    #creates a simple route so you can see the application working before getting into the rest of the tutorial. It creates a connection between the URL /hello and a function that returns a response, the string 'Hello, World!' in this case.

    from . import db

    db.init_app(app)

    #importing the routes from the auth
    from . import auth
    app.register_blueprint(auth.bp)

    from . import blog
    app.register_blueprint(blog.bp)
    app.add_url_rule('/', endpoint='index')
    #However, the endpoint for the index view defined below will be blog.index. Some of the authentication views referred to a plain index endpoint. app.add_url_rule() associates the endpoint name 'index' with the / url so that url_for('index') or url_for('blog.index') will both work, generating the same / URL either way.
